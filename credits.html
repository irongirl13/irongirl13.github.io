	<li>THE logo making was one of the most important part 💂 as i wanted to imprint every page <br/>with a special logo #UNIQUENESS👨🏼‍🎨.
	<li>Then after that Maine ek or skill use kri & that was Watermark.<br/>how to add a watermark to a picture 😅 as u can clearly see watermark on every picture #10VI<br/> that is for one purpose only i.e these pics belongs to u,they r related to u.❕ 
	<li><font color="red">Then after that i learned how to set an icon for every webpage & every page has its own icon i.e <br/>   👇<br/><img src="iconss.jpg" alt="Smiley face"><br/></font></li>
	<li><font color="brown">The one thing that i really wanted is to give the realistic touch to this website<br/> or ye chiz mai html,css,js... etc ka use krke to nhi kr skta tha.<br/><font color="orange"><i>The only way to make a scene realistic is to do it in REAL🙂. </i></font>SO  i decided to do a real thing<br/> and that was coding🤖.I hope that u must have heared about <i>CODECHEF👨‍🍳</i>.<br/>I made a new account on CODECHEF and Participated in March Long Challange and guess what happened..<br/>i made a progress from a 0 star to a <font color="purple"><u>3 star</u></font> (not full fledged😅) coder👨🏽‍💻 on CODECHEF. <br/>All i did this because i had to keep the worth of the name or should i say the username which is <u>vi10</u>🧚‍.<br/>I am adding a snapshot of CODECHEF account and if u have an account on CODECHEF<br/>then u can check my acoount easily by searching the username <u>vi10</u><br/>& if u don't have the one then ask any of your friend & get it verified(without telling them the whole story).<br/>                                                                              👇🏻<br/><img src="3star.jpg" alt="Smiley face">

	<li><font color="#B48510">Video and Audio compression,cropping was one of the minor things🔧 . </font></li>
	<li><font color="#125e8a">GITHUB (open source),One Of the Challanging Task was to Host this WEBSITE,Make it Live.<br/>So I Learned about GITHUB and i was quite impressed by knowing it's Dynamic attributes.<br/>I was also able to figure out a Suitable Domain Name i.e <i>"irongirl13.github.io"</i>.😇 🤠</font></li>
	<li><font color="#047E76">Last but not the least the most engaging part was the making of the collage,<br/>the picture which i used in the login page .It took me hours for getting the desired collag,<br/>adjusting the login window and setting up the marquee tag (haha).<br/>U know sometimes these minute details takes more time🕑 than exeptations⚜️.</font></li>
